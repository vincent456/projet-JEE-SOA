the system is configured to have the client communicate with the Rest service from localhost:8080 to localhost:8081
When you launch all the services, go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). In the interface, type "_http://localhost:8081_" in the "_server_" box. Then you can use the app.
you can then either send a message or fetch new messages
